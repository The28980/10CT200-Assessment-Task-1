## ***10CT200 Assessment Task 1 - UX Design***

### **Project Proposal**
##### *Design Brief*
- I am creating an interactive website based on the book ‘Pawn of Prophecy’ by David Eddings, targeted towards fans of both the book series and fans of fantasy/high fantasy stories and elements.
#
##### *Book*
- The book is ‘Pawn of Prophecy’ by the late author David Eddings, published in April 1982. It is the first book in ‘The Belgariad’, the 5 book series by Eddings. 
- The book acts as an introduction to the series; introducing the world and its gods, important context events in the history of the world and core characters. 
The book, as well as the series, follows Garion, a young, orphan farm boy with a complicated past. He is joined by his great aunt Polgara and her father Belgarath, ancient and old sorcerers who have been alive for centuries. 
The first book follows the trio as they travel far from Garion’s home, never to return, in pursuit of a thief who has stolen a powerful artifact; ‘The Orb of Aldur’. The trio must chase the thief before he can fulfill his master’s evil plan.
- I chose this book because I enjoy reading high-fantasy stories with multiple, but still a manageable amount, of books to enjoy. The worldbuilding and lore in Pawn of Prophecy inspired me to focus more on the story elements, influencing me to create an interactive website as opposed to a game.
#
##### *Format* 
- The UX type I will be creating is an interactive website that presents information on characters, objects and locations from the book.
- This format enhances the story as exposition through history books is prevalent in all of the books in the series. By framing my project as an in-universe text with information about the story, it fits in with ideas that are already in the book series.
#
##### *Target*
- The intended audience for this project are fans of the book/series, as well as fans of fantasy/high fantasy stories and adventures in general. The target audience is around 10-16 years with a slightly above average reading level, however the website won’t be fully restricted and tailored for that audience exactly.
- This project appeals to that audience because of the more mature ideas that are covered in the book more in depth than other stories such as murder/assassination, war and religion. Pawn of Prophecy takes a more grim look at high fantasy adventures, however it still manages to be mostly family-friendly. By maintaining that balance between mature themes and high fantasy adventure, the project will appeal to the target audience in the same way the book does.
- The design for this project will be based on a history book that has information about the story and the events that have taken place. By framing it as an in-universe history book, it allows for a more immersive experience for the audience.
#
##### *Tools*
- The software that I plan to use in this project is AdobeXD.
- AdobeXD is suitable for this project because it is simple to use and understand, while also being effective UX design software for beginners like myself.
#
##### *Mind Map*

- The website format of the project will allow me to focus more on providing the best informational experience for the user, as opposed to a more complicated project idea like a game. A website is more straightforward and is better when you need to get information across.
- The thematic design of the project website will make up for the simplicity of a website, improving in-world immersion for the audience by meshing well with the source material
- Using ‘Pawn of Prophecy’ as the source material for this project allows me to appeal to a wide range of audiences, especially because of the book’s pre-existing fame, not to mention that the story itself is well-written and entertaining.
- The flexible demographic of 10-16 year old high fantasy fans allows the project to cater to their tastes and needs specifically, while also remaining open to anyone who would like to start reading fantasy and is seeing ‘Pawn of Prophecy’ as a way to get into it.
