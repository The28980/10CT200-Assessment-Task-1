## ***10CT200 Assessment Task 1 - UX Design***
#### Alfonso Bangayan

### **Project Proposal**
##### *Design Brief*
- I am creating an interactive website based on the book *Pawn of Prophecy* by David Eddings, targeted towards fans of both the book series and fans of fantasy/high fantasy stories and elements.
##### *Book*
- The book is *Pawn of Prophecy* by the late author David Eddings, published in April 1982. It is the first book in ‘The Belgariad’, the 5 book series by Eddings. 
- The book acts as an introduction to the series; introducing the world and its gods, important context events in the history of the world and core characters. 
The book, as well as the series, follows Garion, a young, orphan farm boy with a complicated past. He is joined by his great aunt Polgara and her father Belgarath, ancient and old sorcerers who have been alive for centuries. 
The first book follows the trio as they travel far from Garion’s home, never to return, in pursuit of a thief who has stolen a powerful artifact; ‘The Orb of Aldur’. The trio must chase the thief before he can fulfill his master’s evil plan.
- I chose this book because I enjoy reading high-fantasy stories with multiple, but still a manageable amount, of books to enjoy. The worldbuilding and lore in *Pawn of Prophecy* inspired me to focus more on the story elements, influencing me to create an interactive website as opposed to a game.
##### *Format* 
- The UX type I will be creating is an interactive website that presents information on characters, objects and locations from the book.
- This format enhances the story as exposition through history books is prevalent in all of the books in the series. By framing my project as an in-universe text with information about the story, it fits in with ideas that are already in the book series.
##### *Target*
- The intended audience for this project are fans of the book/series, as well as fans of fantasy/high fantasy stories and adventures in general. The target audience is around 10-16 years with a slightly above average reading level, however the website won’t be fully restricted and tailored for that audience exactly.
- This project appeals to that audience because of the more mature ideas that are covered in the book more in depth than other stories such as murder/assassination, war and religion. *Pawn of Prophecy* takes a more grim look at high fantasy adventures, however it still manages to be mostly family-friendly. By maintaining that balance between mature themes and high fantasy adventure, the project will appeal to the target audience in the same way the book does.
- The design for this project will be based on a history book that has information about the story and the events that have taken place. By framing it as an in-universe history book, it allows for a more immersive experience for the audience.
##### *Tools*
- The software that I plan to use in this project is AdobeXD.
- AdobeXD is suitable for this project because it is simple to use and understand, while also being effective UX design software for beginners like myself.
##### *Mind Map*

- The website format of the project will allow me to focus more on providing the best informational experience for the user, as opposed to a more complicated project idea like a game. A website is more straightforward and is better when you need to get information across.
- The thematic design of the project website will make up for the simplicity of a website, improving in-world immersion for the audience by meshing well with the source material
- Using *Pawn of Prophecy* as the source material for this project allows me to appeal to a wide range of audiences, especially because of the book’s pre-existing fame, not to mention that the story itself is well-written and entertaining.
- The flexible demographic of 10-16 year old high fantasy fans allows the project to cater to their tastes and needs specifically, while also remaining open to anyone who would like to start reading fantasy and is seeing *Pawn of Prophecy* as a way to get into it.

### **Functional Requirements**
##### *Purpose of Application*
- The purpose of this application is to allow viewers to research characters, objects and locations from the book *Pawn of Prophecy* in an easy and digestible way through the form of a website.
##### *Use Cases*
- Users can use a search bar to search for and select a specific item to view an informational page about the item
- Locations will be displayed as a map of the world, where users can select certain countries or cities on the map to be taken to that location's page.
- Certain pages may have an interactive element implemented (like a minigame or a quiz) that relates to the character/object it is with. The element will be in a small part of the page that the user can select to be redirected to the game.
- Users can use a 'time function' in the website to view information about a character relative to the time-frame they are in; a character may have a different name as the user selects a different time in the story before/after it has changed.
##### *Test Cases*
- The search bar element can be self-tested, as interactions with it don't vary between users. When letters are typed into the search bar, results with the matching letters should show up.
- The map function will be peer-tested to see how intuitive it is as a function. The user should be able to pan across the map and then select a location, where they will then be taken to that location's page.
- Interactive elements of pages will also be peer-tested to assess the engagement of the games added. When a user selects a game, it should open an overlay of the game on top of the page.
- The time-function can be self-tested for functionality, but opinions from others will be used to gauge the creativity of the idea. On the main page of the website, an element like a dial or a slide can be used to switch between the 5 different books of the series, with each book slowly displaying more and more information on certain pages. 
### **Non-Functional Requirements**
##### *Performance*
- Navigation of the website will be smooth, and possibly animated to match the theme of an in-universe history book.
##### *Usability*
- Navigation and use of the website will be reminiscent of wikipedia pages, minus all of the citations and hyperlinked words, so that users will already be semi-familiar with the functionality of the website.
##### *Reliability*
- Testing will take place over a number of different device types, such as phones, laptops and tablets. Different screen sizes will be accounted for during testing and development.
##### *Security*
- The app doesn't collect user data so there are no security concerns regarding personal information.

### **Social Impact**
##### *Target Audience Considerations*
- The target audience is young fantasy fans, so consideration of mature themes, that may confuse, disturb or offend certain audiences, is required. Consideration of disabilities is also important, so features that help with the UX of disabled people should also be considered.
##### *Potential Benefits*
- This project makes it easier to digest and process the lore of the book, which helps ease readers into the story and focus more on the current events of the story instead of being lost in the vast amount of important characters, locations and items.
##### *Potential Risks*
- Potential risks for this project could include the stylistic choice of designing it like a history book. While fans of fantasy may find this idea immersive, some may be displeased by it, wanting a more straightforward or information-intensive experience.
### **Ethical Responsibilities**
##### *User Data & Privacy*
- At no point in the project will the project need to collect sensitive user data, let alone store or handle it.
##### *Representation & Inclusion*
- Representation of characters, events, locations and items within the source material will be presented based on the accounts and information from the book. Sensitive themes and ideas will be presented as they are, without opinion or judgement.
##### *Content Sensitivity*
- The book contains lots of elements of fictional physical and implied violence, such as describing an intense and violent battle between two characters, or brutal scars on a character's face. Prototypes, while still maintaining credibility, will refrain from going into the same amount of detail as the book.
### **Legal Considerations**
##### *Copyright and Intellectual Property*
- Excerpts from the original source material will definitely be used for reference in prototypes, and illustrations from the book will be required to accurately portray certain things. However most elements of the prototype will be researched and created by myself. Where required, credit to external sources will be given.
##### *Terms of Use*
- If I were to launch this project, *Pawn of Prophecy* would still be under copyright protection, meaning I would require legal permission from either the estate of David Eddings to use elements of the story and book in my project or I would have to create the project in accordance with the laws surrounding intestacy (death without a valid will)

### **Researching and Planning**
##### *Gantt Chart*

##### *Existing UI Research*
| UI | Plus | Minus | Implementation |
| - | - | - | - |
| Wikipedia | Pages are packed full of the most information possible, with lots of subcategories that can be quickly accessed on the left side of the page. Accesibility settings on the right side of the page allow the user to easily change the page's appearance and language. | The abundance of hyperlinked words and references can be intimidating for those who are less familiar with technology. Due to Wikipedia being a public forum, it may also rarely be subject to vandalism on its pages. | Wikipedia pages are a good standard for how to display information about a subject on a page, however the prototype will shift more focus onto aesthetics, as well as simplifying the design to make it easier to read. |
| YouTube | Title and part of the description for videos can be seen without having to click on the video, allowing users to briefly check what a video is about. Hovering over thumbnails causes the video to silently play a part of the video on top of the thumbnail. Left side UI is a scroll menu that contain lots of quick access tabs that the user can look through. | YouTube requires a user to search for videos before reccomended videos appear on the home page. While this allows users to have a more personalised experience, this also limits the scope of the type of content the user sees. Reccomended page is also easily influenced by recent searches, which can make it unreliable at times. | The YouTube UI is good at allowing users to preview the content they are about to watch, and is something that should be replicated in the prototype. However, their home page and reccomended system is something I should avoid copying in the prototype. |
| Google Maps | Scrolling in and out function, which allows users to extend their range to fit the entire world map, or fit only a single building or street. Country, state, city and town names appear and disappear as range gets bigger/smaller. Hovering over names shows slideshow of images relating to the area. Clicking on name zooms in on the place and opens an information tab on the left side of the screen. Tab can be dismissed by clicking off of it. Tab shows overview of town information, as well as important tourist information like hotels, events and restraunts. | Google Maps is limited by the information it has access to. Street View images are collected via an on-road car with a camera, aerial shots from drones, photographers who have given Google permission to use their photos as well as various other sources. If a source is unable to reach certain locations, popular examples being majority of Greenland, Russia, China and Africa. This severely impacts the availability of visual data from places like that. | Google Maps is a very good international image source, allowing users to view most parts of the world. While it is limited by restricted areas and physical limitations, my prototype won't be impacted by this because the world the map will be based on is clearly displayed in full in the book series, as well as containing only information about key areas and places. |
##### *UX Design Software Options*
| Software Name | Plus | Minus | Implication |
| - | - | - | - |
| Figma | Figma is cloud-based, meaning I can keep progress consistent over multiple devices. It also has version control, allowing me to revert changes in case of a cloud-save accident. | Figma is limited by a literal limit of 3 pages per file and 3 files per project, making for a total of 9 pages per project, which can be very limiting for much larger scale products. Many limitations on Figma are based on paid subscriptions. | For a smaller project, Figma would definitely be an effective free alternative to both Axure and Adobe, however that means many features and extra elements that would be helpful to have during the project are stuck behind payment. |
| Adobe XD | Not only does Adobe XD have various tutorials to help users become more familiar with how it functions, it's also built for many parts of the UX design process such as wireframing, prototyping and eventual release. As an Adobe product, it is connected to the Adobe Creative Cloud which can be easily accessed. | Adobe XD is no longer available for individual purchase, meaning accessing the app requires a subscription to have access to every Adobe app, making it the least cost-effective option on the list. Furthermore, Adobe XD is no longer subject to updates, meaning over time it could lose relevancy as more effective and up-to-date products and tools are created. | Adobe XD is the most reliable option as it is the product of a very credible organisation. However, it is very hard to gain access to and the only reason it is a valid option is because the school grants students free access to all Adobe apps, including Adobe XD. However, for an independent creator, Adobe XD is not a cost-effective option. |
| Axure RP | Axure RP offers lots of very convenient features, such as built-in interactions for certain elements that can speed up the process of development. It allows users to create much more dynamic UX that set them apart from other websites. | Axure has no free services and has a minimum subscription price of $29/month. For continuous use, this might be seen as worthwhile but for a singular project it's not very cost effective, especially when there are free applications. Axure RP also has a very steep learning curve, not being very beginner-friendly and requiring lots of practice to utilise effectively. | Axure RP would be a very useful resource to have during development if it was less expensive and more beginner friendly. Otherwise, it's unlikely that I'll use this software for developing my prototypes and final project. |
